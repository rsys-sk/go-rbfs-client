/*
 * RBFS Operational State API
 *
 * This contract describes the RBFS Operational State API contract defined by RBMS, the RtBrick Management System. This API is a _consumer-driven_ API, which means that all changes to this API **must be approved** by RBMS, the consumer of this API to avoid compatibility issues.  The API is kept backwards-compatible and anyone is allowed to _use_ this API.  The consumer of the API _must_ ignore additional attributes not explained in this specification. Additional attributes are _not_ considered violating backwards compatibility. In contrary, additional attributes allow extending the API while preserving backward compatibility.
