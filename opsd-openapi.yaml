  title: RBFS Operational State API
  description: | 
    This contract describes the RBFS Operational State API contract defined by RBMS, the RtBrick Management System.
    This API is a _consumer-driven_ API, which means that all changes to this API **must be
    approved** by RBMS, the consumer of this API to avoid compatibility issues.
    
    The API is kept backwards-compatible and anyone is allowed to _use_ this API.
    
    The consumer of the API _must_ ignore additional attributes not explained in this specification.
    Additional attributes are _not_ considered violating backwards compatibility. In contrary,
    additional attributes allow extending the API while preserving backward compatibility.

        Pings the given destination from the specified source IP or source IFL with the provided settings.

        Three options exist to specify the ping destination:

        1. Use `destination_ip` to specify the destination IP address in IPv6 or IPv4 format.
        2. Use `destination_aaaa` to query the DNS for an AAAA record for the specified host name.
        3. Use `destination_a` to query the DNS for an A record for the specified host name.

        The precedence is in the above ordering if multiple destinations are specified.
        An error is returned if no destination is specified.

        Injects a single VLAN profile object into the global VLAN profile BDS table.

        A VLAN profile has a composite key of up to 5 parameters, which are modelled as query parameters because of the many valid combinations.
        The keys specified in the VLAN profile must match the query parameters. Otherwise the request gets rejected.
        
        This endpoint creates a VLAN profile object from the specified keys when no VLAN profile is specified. 
        This is a convenience function to simplify creation of VLAN profiles that consists of key attributes only.
